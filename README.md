# Bad Bridge

One-way NFT bridge, Cosmos Hub cw721 -> Ethereum ERC721. Reuses the IBC Eureka `cosmoshub-0` SP1 light client already on Ethereum mainnet, so no relayer, no channel, no light client of our own. Design is in `bad-bridge-design.md`.

## How it works

1. `send_nft` to the Hub escrow, with your ETH address as the message
2. Escrow stores a raw record: key `"b" || token_id`, value `<20 byte ETH address>`
3. Batcher proves that record against the app hash the Eureka client stores, wraps it in a Groth16 proof with SP1
4. `BadBridge.submitBatch` verifies the proof and records token id + recipient
5. Anyone calls `claim(id)`, which mints that id to the recipient

The batcher can't lie, every record is checked on-chain. Worst case it just doesn't submit.

Metadata doesn't move. `tokenURI` is `baseURI + id`, same IPFS folder as the Hub.

## Gotchas we hit

- Tokenfactory "ticket token" over Eureka ICS20 is dead, IBC v2 rejects denoms with a `/`
- Eth router `recvPacket` is permissioned, we can't relay ourselves
- Eth client only moves when Eureka relays something. Send a little ATOM over Eureka to nudge it (~10 min)
- publicnode prunes too much, use polkachu / kjnodes / ecostake for proofs
- Use the `sp1-programs-v2.0.0` ELF, HEAD builds the wrong vkey
- `ConsensusState.timestamp` is nanoseconds

## Before real Bad Kids

- Confirm `cw721-migration` (`cosmos12gsv9tmjhhg86wg9fnd9cnju28jx3fxva9cn8dh9meketkfxxajqmg3exz`) calls the receiver hook on `send_nft`
- Escrow with `--no-admin`
- Audit `parse()` and the escrow receive path, fuzz more
- Rotate the prover key, it leaked into a chat log
