// Cross-cuts the Hub adapter, the Ethereum adapter and the Succinct network client into one "prove my own
// kids" flow: read each escrow record's Merkle proof, request one Groth16 proof covering all of them,
// submitBatch it. Own kids only — the connected wallet's, never scanning or batching anyone else's records
// (see the build plan's scope note) — but any number of them together, since one proof/one submitBatch tx
// covers many records at close to the same cost as one (Ethereum-side verification is a fixed-size pairing
// check regardless of batch size; the SP1 proving cost is the only thing that scales, and sublinearly at
// that since it's one zkVM run either way). Behind real.tsx's lazy boundary like hub/ and eth/ already are,
// so cosmjs-types and the zstd WASM module never load in the demo bundle.
