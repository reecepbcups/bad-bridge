 * | `home-eth`    | ownerOf(id) succeeded (whoever owns it now)                 |
 * | `ready`       | proven(id) != 0, not minted                                 |
 * | `home-hub`    | no escrow record                                            |
 * | `crossing`    | record, but Hs unknown: don't guess between 2 and 3         |
 * | `locked`      | record and Hs, but the client hasn't been read              |
 * | `catching-up` | client.latestHeight <= Hs                                   |
 * | `proving`     | client.latestHeight > Hs, not proven                        |
 *
 * Proven and minted are permanent facts on Ethereum, so they win over everything: unknown Hs, a missing
 * record read, or a frozen client. A frozen client doesn't change the stage; Health.frozen drives the banner.
 *
 * The client must pass Hs (latestHeight > Hs, not >=): the batcher proves against the app hash at client
 * height H, which commits to state after block H-1, and the record is in state after block Hs.
 *
 * `locked` is kept as its own stage rather than folded into `catching-up`: without the client height there's
 * no honest blocksToGo. It's a fallback (first paint after a send, or Ethereum reads failing); the hooks never
 * return it once a client read has succeeded.
