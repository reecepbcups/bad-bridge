// Two layers:
// - Hook queries ('trips', 'trip', 'owned', 'health', 'sanity', 'estimate'): what the hooks return. They poll.
// - Raw reads ('read', …): one chain read each, fetched through queryClient.query() from inside the hook
//   queries. They never poll on their own; their staleTime decides whether a hook refresh re-reads them, so
//   hooks share them (one eth.client() for every hook on the page) and immutable facts are read once.
