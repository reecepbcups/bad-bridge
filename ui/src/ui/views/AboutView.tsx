            <summary>Why can't kids come back?</summary>
            <p>
              Going back would need the Hub to check proofs about Ethereum, and it can't do that today. Once a kid
              crosses, it stays on Ethereum.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Why does it take a while?</summary>
            <p>
              Ethereum only learns about new Hub blocks when IBC Eureka relays a transfer. After that, the prover bundles
              waiting kids into one proof. So the wait depends on how far behind Ethereum is

          <details>
            <summary>Does the art change?</summary>
            <p>No. The Ethereum kid points at the same IPFS folder as the Hub kid, so the picture and traits are identical.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What happens to the kid on the Hub?</summary>
            <p>
              It stays locked in the escrow, which has no way to hand it back. That's what makes the Ethereum kid the real
              one.

            <p>
              Anyone. A claim always mints the kid to the address it was sent to, so it's safe for a friend (or a bot) to
              claim for you.

            <p>
              Same number, same art, but they trade separately. An Ethereum kid trades on Ethereum marketplaces, not on
              Stargaze or other Hub marketplaces.
